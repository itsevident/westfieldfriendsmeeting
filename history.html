        <h1>Historical Perspective</h1>
        
        <h3>The Past</h3>
        <p>In 1785 Land on Riverton Road valued at &quot;Six Pounds, Hard Money&quot; was bought and a stone building was erected. This building was used for Sunday worship until 1799 when more land was acquired. Once part of the land owned by Thomas Lippincott - this was called his &quot;West Field&quot; - hence, the name which remains today. The meeting house built on this spot in 1800 continued until 1859 when it was destroyed by fire. That same year, the brick meeting house was built and the trees planted.  Completion was April 13,1860, the date of the firing on Fort Sumter, the event that was to lead to the Civil War.</p>
        <p>Monies realized from the sale of additional land were used to construct a new building adjacent to the original one. The old building continues as an annex to the school while the new meeting house is used for all worship and social functions.</p>
        <p>Friends have historically felt that education was a cornerstone, an integral part of any foundation. The present Westfield Friends School had its beginnings in the home of Abraham Warrington, near Fork Landing on the Pennsauken Creek in 1785. With the exception of three years from 1905- 1907, the school has been continually active since 1795. The present building dates from 1840 and has been enlarged five times.</p>
        
        <h3>The Present</h3>
        <p>Quaker testimonies - those tenets of our belief- continue to guide as we look for answers and directions in our lives.</p>
        <p>Harmony - Quakers are widely known as people who believe war is wrong. Pacifism remains an integral of our belief system - if God is a spirit of love, how can that spirit want us to take part in something which is cruel and destructive.</p>
        <p>Community - we should use our special talents and abilities to help others. Work is the outward expression of our belief and as such we can be of service to God</p>
        <p>Equality - historically, Quakers have believed that men and women are equal. We are opposed to racism, class discrimination and oppressive treatment of people anywhere.</p>
        <p>Simplicity - Quakers believe that simplicity gives a person the wholeheartedness necessary for inward search. The absence of what is unnecessary applies to speech, dress, furnishings and architecture as well as business and income. The inner person is more important than the outer and the right use of world resources as well as of personal assets is a deep concern of many Friends.</p>
        <p>Quaker interest in community betterment and conservation is found in the establishment of Cinnaminson's Wood Park and the 90 acre &quot;Open Space easement&quot; of the Taylor farm which will ensure a natural habitat for wild life in the future.</p>
        
        <h3>The Future</h3>
        <p>The search for truth and meaning remain as guiding principles to all Friends. They continue to try to show by example that man is God's creation and should show in all our deeds and words. Our committee structures reflect our interest in the world which is larger than just our surroundings - religious education, outreach, peace and social concerns, environment, care of resources - all strive to improve our nature and do as we believe it is known to us. From the humble beginnings in the &quot;West Field&quot;, Westfield Friends Meeting has tried to incorporate into its growth those guiding principles from our history.</p>
